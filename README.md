# core8

My first attempt to write an emulator. Ever! 

This is work in progress and might even be finished eventually.

It is able to successfully run DEC's hardware diagnostics (part #1) `MAINDEC-8E-D0AB-PB`. 

Now halfway thru `MAINDEC-8E-D0BB-PB`, but interrupts are tricky and poorly documented.
