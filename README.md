# core8

My first attempt to write an emulator. Ever! 

This is work in progress and might even be finished eventually.

The following MAINDEC diagnostics have been tested and run successfully:
 * Instruction tests (part 1&2): `MAINDEC-8E-D0AB-PB` + `MAINDEC-8E-D0BB-PB`
 * Adder tests: `MAINDEC-8E-D0CC-PB`
